Task: Design and implement a Name_pairs class that holds pairs
      (name, age) 
==============================================================
Data members:
* name is a string stored in a vector of strings (member)
* age is a double stored in a vector of doubles (member)

==============================================================
Member functions: 
* read_names() operation should read a series of names and stores
  them in the name vector
* read_ages() operation should prompt the user for an age for each name
	- needs to know how many names are in the vector 
	- prompts user for the age of each element in the names vector 
	- output the name so the user knows which name they are assigning an age to 
* print() operation should print out the name, age pairs (name[i], age[i]) one per line
	- do this in the order determined by the name vector 
* sort() operation sould sort the name vector in alphabetical order and reorganizes the 
  age vector to match 
	- most difficult part for me 

=============================================================
Files:
* main.cpp - where main() lives 
* Name_pairs.h - where class declarations live
* Name_pairs.cpp - where class definitions live
