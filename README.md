This repository contains code from exercises found in Bjarne Stroustrup's "Programming:Principles and Practice, 2nd ed."

I chose to stick with learning C++ well and decided to read through a programming book written by the very man who created the language itself. 

The code doesn't include examples from the book, but instead it includes my implementations I created while attempting the drills and exercises while studying the book. Some of the code is not complete or need to be refactored because it is missing a crucial programming concept that I have not yet learned. 

The strange looking header file included is the author's header file that he created in order to help the student with the book.
